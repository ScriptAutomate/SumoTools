SumoTools PowerShell Module
=========

This is a PowerShell Module of functions running against the Sumo Logic API.
It requires version 3.0 of PowerShell, as data is returned in JSON format and the module uses the ConvertFrom-Json function. 
All commands have been tested on PowerShell 4.0, but should work on v3.0+

Please take a look at the GitHub wiki for further information:

These functions utilize the Sumo Logic API as documented here:

I will periodically be blogging about it here:
